Remove Source Map Url Webpack Plugin
====================================

This is a webpack plugin that removes `# sourceMappingURL` after compilation.<br>
It's a quick fix for wrong `# sourceMappingURL` comments left in vendor source code when compiling without minification (causing 404 responses from the server).

Maintainer: Ruben Barilani


## Install 

Install the plugin via npm:

```bash
$ npm install @rbarilani/remove-source-map-url-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

## Usage

```js
var RemoveSourceMapUrlWebpackPlugin = require('@rbarilani/remove-source-map-url-webpack-plugin');
var webpackConfig = {
  entry: 'index.js',
  output: {
    path: 'dist',
    filename: 'index_bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [
  	new RemoveSourceMapUrlWebpackPlugin({
       test: /index_bundle\.js$/
  	})
  ]
};
```
